# Eisen Bahn

A train roguelike with a novel pixel matching generation system (PMG). 

## The Game
Eisen Bahn is a project made by a husband and wife team to complete an entire roguelike set in the setting of neverending trains. Each train car entered could lead to new enemies, crafting materials, item shops, or portals to other realms.

### The Current State
Pixel Matching Generation is very easy to use and needs no advanced match skills to learn. One could probably program one in 80 lines of code or less and uses only standard loops and if statements. And because generation happens with textures there should be many ways to optimize it further.

### The Art
All the pixel art is made by the fairer side of the team, AemiG. Here's a sample of some art she's prepared while Zaya works on the programming.
